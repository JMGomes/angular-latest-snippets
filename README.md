# Angular TypeScript Snippets suitable for V19

Works with Angular v19. Snippets for TypeScript and HTML

## Features

This extension for VSCode adds snippets for the most common angular code. Adds snippets for:

- Standalone as default for directive, components, pipes...
- Signals (effect(), computed(), input(), output())
- New Control flow (@if, @else, @for, @switch)
- Deferrable Views (@defer, @placeholder, @loading)
- Functional Route Guards

## Usage

Type part of a snippet, press enter, and the snippet unfolds.

Alternatively, press Ctrl+Space (Windows, Linux) or Cmd+Space (macOS) to activate snippets from within the editor.

## Requirements

If you have any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them.
